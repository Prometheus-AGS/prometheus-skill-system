# run-fixture-suite.sh — prove the adversarial review gate DISCRIMINATES.
#
# The eight historical reviews in this repository all returned PASS while being
# Claude-judging-Claude. A suite that asserted "a review completed" would have
# been green for every one of them. This suite therefore asserts the only thing
# that matters: flawed artifacts are BLOCKed, clean ones PASS, and the judge is
# provably not the producer.
#
# Groups:
#   A  live judge — flawed → BLOCK + verified-distinct; clean → PASS
#   B  fail-closed — each creator with KBD_PRODUCER_MODEL unset → exit 2
#   C  retry bound — repeated CRITICALs stop at the cap for both creators
#
# Groups B and C make NO judge calls; only Group A does. See --help for the
# judge-call ceiling and why this suite is on-demand rather than per-commit.
#
# Exit: 0 all assertions held · 1 an assertion failed · 2 setup/preconditions
# bash 3.2 compatible.
