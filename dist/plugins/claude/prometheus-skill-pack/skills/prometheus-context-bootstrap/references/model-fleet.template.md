# Model fleet

Profile in AGENTS.md: `__PROFILE__` (set `__DATE__`)

AGENTS.md is per repository, not per model. Every model listed below reads the
same file, so the weakest one governs its content. Record the fleet here — a
profile choice nobody wrote down gets re-argued every time someone new arrives.

## Models that work this repo

## Before switching to lean

Do not adopt `lean` because a model is reported to be capable. Adopt it when
this repo's task set says so.

1. Fix ~10 representative tasks for this repo.
2. Run them under `mixed`, per model. Record pass rate and token cost.
3. Run them under `lean`, per model. Record the same.
4. Adopt `lean` only if no model regressed.

Pass rate is the gate. Token cost is the tiebreaker. A configuration that costs
less and passes less is a regression carrying an efficiency argument.

## Results
