# --- judge transport ----------------------------------------------------------
# The judge talks to an OpenAI-compatible /v1/chat/completions endpoint. That is
# the stable contract: `liter-llm` ships `api` and `mcp` subcommands (it is a
# proxy SERVER), so the previous `liter-llm complete` call could never succeed —
# and because the guard only checked that the BINARY existed, the failure was
# reported as "liter-llm unavailable" rather than as the CLI-contract mismatch
# it actually was. Probing the endpoint keeps the diagnosis honest.
#
# LITER_LLM_BASE_URL overrides; otherwise try the local openai-proxy, then a
# liter-llm `api` server on its default port.
# Endpoint + model resolution live in ONE shared library so a config change never
# requires editing this script (and never an edit inside a plugin cache, which the
# next install silently destroys). See shared/scripts/lib/kbd-model-resolve.sh.
