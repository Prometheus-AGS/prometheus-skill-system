## UI/UX work routing

Before writing or modifying any UI/UX code in this repo, the AI agent
**MUST** follow these steps in order. The roster of skills + source
URLs is cached at
`.kbd-orchestrator/references/uiux-skill-roster.md` (refreshable via
`/kbd-inject-agent-rules --pack uiux-routing --refresh`).

1. **Memory consult.** Run `/kbd-memory-recall` (default-on via
   `assess:before` hook) to populate `prior-context.md` with prior
   UI/UX decisions in surreal-memory.
2. **UI/UX Pro Max analysis.** Run the design-system + audit pass on
   target components / pages. Pull palette + font + spacing + a11y
   recommendations from its database.
3. **Impeccable commands.** Always run `/impeccable audit` +
   `/impeccable critique`. Then run the work-specific commands —
   `/impeccable polish` before shipping, `/impeccable distill` when
   simplifying, `/impeccable animate` when adding motion,
   `/impeccable harden` for edge-case + i18n, etc.
4. **Anthropic skills.** Consult `frontend-design` + `ux-designer`
   for intentional design + UX-engineer review perspective.
5. **Vercel skills.** Consult React Best Practices + Composition
   Patterns. For the entity-explorer panel and Chrome extension work
   specifically (changes 10 + 11), **also web-search**: "runtime
   devtools page best practices" AND "Chrome MV3 devtools panel
   patterns" / "react-devtools bridge architecture".
6. **Summarise.** Write a one-paragraph distillation of the relevant
   best practices for this specific task. Reference the roster
   entries you actually consulted.
7. **Only then write code.** The summary above is the prompt context
   for the implementation step.

This routing block is auto-managed; re-run
`/kbd-inject-agent-rules --pack uiux-routing` to update. See
`kbd-process-orchestrator/skills/kbd-inject-agent-rules/SKILL.md` for
the `--pack` flag and the fenced-region machinery.
