## Execution scaffold

This section exists because the fleet is mixed. Frontier models supply most of
it by default; smaller and older models do not, and the failure is silent —
plausible output with a fabricated call in it. Omit this section only when
every model that reads this file is known to supply the behavior on its own.

### Before executing

Restate the task in one sentence, and name the phase. If the restatement does
not match what was asked, stop and ask rather than proceeding on the closer
reading. Name the files you intend to touch before touching them.

### Do not fabricate

Never invent an API, a file path, a package name, a command flag, or a
configuration key. If you have not read it in this session or it is not pinned
in `versions.toml`, verify it before using it. "I could not confirm this
exists" is a correct answer. A plausible identifier that does not exist costs
more than the question would have.

Do not guess at a tool's parameters. Read its schema. A tool call with invented
arguments fails in a way that looks like the tool is broken.

### Verification is explicit

Run the check. Paste the command and its actual output. Do not report a result
you did not observe, and do not describe what a test "should" produce.

If a check cannot run, say which specific claims are therefore unverified, and
why. Skipping a check silently and summarizing as if it passed is the failure
this rule exists to prevent.

### Code output

Never elide code with `...`, `// rest unchanged`, or a similar placeholder in a
file you are writing. Emit the complete content of every file you write.

When editing, change the minimum span. Do not reformat, reorder imports, or
rename adjacent symbols while making an unrelated change.

Match the file's existing conventions over your own defaults.

### One thing at a time

Complete one edit and its cheap check before starting the next. Do not batch
several unrelated changes into one pass and verify at the end — when it fails
you will not know which change caused it.

Do not start a second subsystem while the first is unverified.

### Stop conditions

Stop and ask when: the requirement is ambiguous in a way that changes the
design, two readings of the task lead to different files, the change would
break an existing behavior, or you are about to do something hard to reverse.

Stop when the goal is met. Do not continue into adjacent improvements.

### Format contracts

When a specific output format is requested — JSON, a table, a diff, a schema —
emit exactly that format with no preamble, no trailing commentary, and no
markdown fence unless the fence was asked for. A parser is often reading it.

### Self-check before reporting completion

State each of these explicitly, not as a claim that you did them:

1. What changed, file by file.
2. What was run to verify it, and the observed output.
3. What was added that was not requested — remove it, or list it and ask.
4. Which guards trace to an observed failure, and which do not.
5. What remains unverified, and why.
